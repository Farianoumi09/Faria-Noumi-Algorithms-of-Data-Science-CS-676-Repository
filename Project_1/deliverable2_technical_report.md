#Public Health Credibility Scoring System

#Introduction

The public health credibility scoring system is designed to assess the reliability of online health and medical content by combining machine learning-inspired analysis with rule-based heuristics. The system generates a reproducible credibility score between 0 and 100 by evaluating features such as author presence, domain credibility, citations, text objectivity, and sentiment neutrality. The machine learning-inspired component weights these features to simulate predictive scoring, while rule-based adjustments reward trusted domains like cdc.gov and who.int and penalize untrusted sources like mercola.com. Sensational language, such as excessive ALL CAPS words or exclamation points, triggers penalties to improve interpretability. This hybrid methodology balances predictive power with transparency, ensuring users understand why a source received its score.

#Understanding Python Class Objects

A class object in Python serves as a blueprint for creating instances, which are the actual objects. Classes define the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that their instances will have. In this project, classes such as CredibilityAnalyzer encapsulate methods for feature extraction, scoring, and text parsing. Using classes promotes modularity, code organization, and reusability. Each class allows the system to maintain consistent functionality across multiple inputs, enabling easy extension and maintenance of the credibility scoring system.

#Docstrings

Docstrings are multi-line strings used to describe modules, classes, or functions. They provide built-in documentation that makes code more readable and maintainable. In this system, functions like fetch_text(url) include docstrings explaining their purpose, input parameters, and returned output. These docstrings can be accessed using Pythonâ€™s help() function, allowing developers to quickly understand how each component works without reading the full implementation. Proper documentation ensures that the system is reproducible and understandable for collaborators.

#Initialization with __init__

The __init__ method in Python classes is a constructor automatically called when an instance is created. It initializes attributes and prepares necessary components before the object is used. For example, a URLValidator or CredibilityAnalyzer class uses __init__ to store the input URL or text content and configure initial parameters such as scoring weights. This ensures that each object is fully prepared to perform its methods, such as feature extraction or scoring, immediately after instantiation.

analyzer = CredibilityAnalyzer("https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html")
which prepares the object to analyze this specific URL.

#Error Handling

Errors in programs can occur due to invalid inputs, network failures, or unexpected conditions. To prevent crashes, the system employs try-except blocks, allowing functions to fail gracefully. For instance, when fetching text from a URL using requests, a network error or timeout is caught, and the function returns None or a fallback value instead of terminating the program. This approach ensures robustness and reliability, allowing the system to continue processing other tasks even if a single input fails.

try:
    text = get_article_text_from_url(url)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
    text = None

#Return Statements

Good practices for return statements ensure that functions provide clear, meaningful, and consistent outputs. In this system, functions return structured data, often as dictionaries containing the final credibility score, individual feature contributions, and explanatory notes. This approach avoids returning ambiguous values such as None and facilitates further automated processing or human interpretation. Consistent return structures make the system easier to maintain, debug, and extend with additional features.

{
    "score": 85,
    "explanations": ["[+25] Source Reputation: Domain 'cdc.gov' is trusted.", "[+10] Author Presence: Author detected."]
}

#Experimental Validation

Testing the system with articles from credible sources such as cdc.gov and who.int shows that these sources consistently score above 80, while pseudoscientific or misleading sources score below 50. Articles mixing objective and opinion-based content receive intermediate scores. Sensational language penalties successfully reduce the scores of clickbait-style articles, demonstrating that the hybrid approach effectively captures both content quality and domain reliability. The system is scalable, modular, and reproducible using standard Python libraries, including requests, beautifulsoup4, textblob, and trafilatura.
