# Description: Advanced Credibility Scoring App for Chatbot
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# This app estimates the credibility of a given text input using
# a mix of heuristic (keyword-based) scoring and random variation.
# It is designed for demonstration and can easily be replaced
# with a fine-tuned Hugging Face transformer model later.
