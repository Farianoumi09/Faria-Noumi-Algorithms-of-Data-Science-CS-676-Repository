# TinyTroupe Persona Simulator (Mock Implementation)

**Note:** This app uses a mock implementation of TinyTroupe. The real TinyTroupe package is not currently available for Python 3.12, so we created a simulated version that mimics its functionality. This allows us to:

- Explore multi-persona AI conversation simulation  
- Evaluate responses and maintain conversation history  
- Complete Deliverable 1 objectives without requiring the unavailable package
