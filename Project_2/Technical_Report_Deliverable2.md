---

## Objective

The objective of Deliverable 2 was to complete the development of the TinyTroupe Persona Simulator to a fully functional beta state and submit a detailed technical report documenting its capabilities. This deliverable represents the core implementation phase, where all major features were integrated, tested, and refined to create a robust system capable of supporting multi-turn persona-based simulations. The simulator is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users, allowing them to explore diverse perspectives on prompts, workflows, or features without requiring programming expertise.  

This phase focuses on producing a tool that is both functionally reliable and capable of generating actionable insights. Each persona is modeled with specific traits, professional context, and communication style, influencing how they respond to prompts. Users can select multiple personas and specify conversation turns to simulate realistic dialogues, providing a controlled environment to evaluate interaction patterns and response diversity. Automated evaluation metrics and persistent conversation logging ensure that outputs are measurable, reproducible, and informative. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver a beta version that balances technical depth, usability, and analytical value, forming a foundation for future enhancements and real-world deployment.

## Beta Version Overview

The beta version of TinyTroupe provides a functional platform capable of simulating multiple personas simultaneously. Predefined personas exhibit distinct traits such as analytical, empathetic, humorous, or creative, shaping how each responds to user prompts. Users can select any combination of personas, input a discussion prompt or feature description, and define the number of conversation turns. Each persona generates responses per turn that reflect its characteristics while introducing natural variation, such as humor or empathy, when applicable.  

Multi-turn simulation demonstrates consistency in persona behavior across consecutive exchanges while allowing for diversity in phrasing and emphasis. All responses are evaluated automatically and displayed in real-time through the Streamlit interface, accompanied by a quality score derived from sentiment and response length. Additionally, conversation logs are saved in Markdown format with timestamps, enabling retrospective analysis, documentation, and reproducibility. These capabilities allow stakeholders to compare persona perspectives, track behavior over multiple turns, and generate actionable insights, enhancing the platform’s value for product development, marketing, education, and research scenarios.

## Technical Implementation

The TinyTroupe Persona Simulator is implemented entirely in Python, with Streamlit providing the interactive user interface. The core simulation logic is encapsulated in two primary classes: `Persona` and `Troupe`. The `Persona` class defines individual attributes such as name, traits, age, and profession, which collectively determine response style, tone, and content. The `Troupe` class manages collections of personas and coordinates their responses across multiple simulation turns, ensuring that each persona behaves according to its defined characteristics.  

Responses are generated by combining persona traits, professional context, and user prompts. Random modifiers, such as humor or empathy, are applied based on persona attributes to introduce realistic conversational variation. This modular design separates simulation logic, evaluation, and interface functionality, making the system extensible for future improvements such as AI API integration, context retention for multi-turn conversations, and analytical dashboards. Emphasis is placed on clarity, maintainability, reproducibility, and usability, while retaining engaging and contextually meaningful persona interactions.

## Simulation and Evaluation Workflow

The simulation workflow begins with user input, where personas are selected, a prompt is entered, and the number of conversation turns is defined. During each turn, the `Troupe.simulate()` method generates persona-specific responses influenced by traits and professional context. Randomized modifiers are applied where relevant to simulate realistic dialogue patterns.  

Each response is evaluated automatically using a combination of sentiment analysis and response length, producing a quality score between 0 and 100. This scoring method ensures that responses are assessed for both informational depth and emotional tone. Outputs are displayed in real-time within the interface, and conversation details—including prompts, responses, and evaluation scores—are saved as timestamped Markdown logs. This enables structured post-simulation analysis, comparison of persona behaviors, and reproducibility of results, supporting iterative development and informed decision-making.

## User Interface

The Streamlit interface is designed for simplicity, clarity, and accessibility. Users can input prompts, select multiple personas from a dropdown menu, specify the number of conversation turns via a slider, and initiate simulations with a single button click. Persona responses are displayed in real-time along with evaluation scores, providing immediate feedback on the quality and tone of each response.  

All sessions are automatically logged in Markdown format, allowing users to review, document, and analyze past simulations. The interface was carefully designed to prioritize intuitive interaction, responsive display, and ease of use for non-technical stakeholders. The combination of real-time interaction, automated evaluation, and persistent logging provides a professional, user-friendly experience suitable for research, education, marketing, and product development.

## Use Cases

The TinyTroupe Persona Simulator is applicable across multiple domains and project stages. In product design, personas can provide early feedback on workflows, UI elements, and feature functionality prior to user testing. Marketing teams can simulate responses from different customer archetypes to assess messaging effectiveness, campaigns, and promotional content. In educational settings, the simulator demonstrates differences in communication style, reasoning, and perspective-taking among personas, providing a rich learning experience for students and professionals.  

Additionally, the platform supports early concept testing, enabling teams to anticipate potential user reactions without deploying prototypes. Its flexibility allows adaptation to various industries, feature types, and development phases, from early concept exploration to detailed design validation. By producing measurable, reproducible outputs, the simulator provides a reliable framework for iterative analysis and evidence-based decision-making.

## Feedback and Improvements

Instructor feedback and internal testing guided several enhancements during the beta phase. The interface was refined for clarity, visual formatting, and responsiveness. Evaluation metrics were adjusted to improve accuracy by refining sentiment normalization and weighting mechanisms. The logging system was standardized to ensure consistent Markdown exports for documentation and review. Error handling was improved to prevent crashes from invalid inputs or long simulations.  

Design trade-offs prioritized reproducibility, interpretability, and usability over full randomness, ensuring consistent yet realistic persona behavior. These improvements strengthened the platform’s functionality, reliability, and accessibility, resulting in a robust system capable of producing actionable insights while remaining user-friendly for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Future Work

Future development plans include integrating API-driven AI models for authentic persona responses, implementing memory for multi-turn context retention, and adding visualization dashboards to analyze sentiment, response diversity, and interaction trends. The system will support importing and exporting custom personas in JSON format, allowing teams to extend and personalize simulations. Hosting the application as a web service with user authentication is also planned to facilitate broader access and collaboration.  

These enhancements aim to improve realism, interactivity, and usability, enabling the simulator to support real-world product development, marketing research, and educational applications. The improvements will allow for richer, more accurate simulations, deeper analytical insights, and seamless integration into professional workflows.
